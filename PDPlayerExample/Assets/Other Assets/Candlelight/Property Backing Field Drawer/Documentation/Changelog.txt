Changelist:

2.01:
    - Free up memory when selection has changed.
2.0:
    - Unity 4.5 is new minimum version.
    - Added IPropertyBackingFieldCompatible interface and
      PropertyBackingFieldCompatibleObject base class, which are used to support
      custom serializable structs and classes.
    - You can now use setter logic that only triggers on value changes! Note
      that custom serializable classes will always supply a clone.
    - Full support for undo/redo and reverting to prefab for all property types
      in any play mode state!
    - PropertyBackingFieldDrawer.DisplayArrayPropertyField() and
      PropertyBackingFieldDrawer.DisplayReorderableListPropertyField() were
      removed and are no longer necessary!
    - No naming assumptions are made for IList backing fields and their
      respective properties anymore!
    - Properties and their respective backing fields need not match type, as
      long as the backing field type is assignable from the property type.
    - Fixed bug that could cause some enum properties to not be set properly.
    - Fixed bug calculating property drawer height when property was followed by
      another whose name was prefixed with the preceding property's name.
    - Changed some access modifiers and method signatures of utility methods
      which should generally not be needed anyway.
1.05:
    - Added PropertyBackingFieldDrawer.DisplayArrayPropertyField() and
      PropertyBackingFieldDrawer.DisplayReorderableListPropertyField() utility
      methods for use in custom editors to invoke array property setters when
      array size drops to 0.
1.04:
    - Fixed bug that could cause array setters on prefabs to infinitely invoke.
    - Some accomodations for multi-select.
    - Library updates.
1.03:
    - Fixed bug that prevented detection of nonpublic setters.
1.02:
    - Backing fields for properties with no setter now display as disabled
      fields in the inspector, rather than throwing an exception.
1.01:
    - Property Backing Fields was released to the world!
