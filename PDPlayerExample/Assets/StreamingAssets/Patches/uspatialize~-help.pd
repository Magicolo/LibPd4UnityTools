#X text 21 136 This object will spatialize an input around the source
object defined in Unity. The argument is the name of the module which
will tell Unity which module settings to use. You can create modules
in Unity's inspector under the PDPlayer.cs script. You should always
send signals that are synthesized by Pure Data in a [uspatialize~]
object so the signal responds to Play \, Pause and Stop commands. If
you don't want any spatialization to occur \, just leave the source
in the module settings to be equal to null.;
